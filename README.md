# Artifact Service


This repo contains the examples and discussion points covered in the meeting on 8/11. Please also see the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HGwQjaeHLIRFaR_sbrOJlfTjNJL6IJ9Xqed5-UsOa6M) for additional information and explanations. There are two Python files here:

* `demo_ml.py` - This was the running example using the version of Flyte/Union we showed. There is a companion notebook `artifact_user.ipynb` to demonstrate what the local notebook experience would look like.
* `etl.py` - This is not fully running code but does illustrate how Flyte can be leveraged to solve traditional etl problems. We would love to partner on both paradigms of course, helping to bridge the gap between data and ML.
